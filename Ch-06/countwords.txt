A "potentially catastrophic" Hurricane Maria, now a Category 5 storm, made landfall on Dominica late Monday and continued its path toward the US territory of Puerto Rico.
A National Hurricane Center statement said Maria is the strongest storm on record to make landfall in Dominica. It came ashore on the island country at 9:15 p.m. It had winds of 160 miles per hour.
The mammoth storm -- measured by an US Air Force Reserve C-130 Hurricane Hunter -- was moving west-northwest at 9 mph.

"My roof is gone," Dominica Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said in a Facebook post. "I am at the complete mercy of the hurricane. House is flooding."
Later, he said, "I have been rescued."
